# Software-Construction-Group-2

## Phase 2 
* For our project for Phase-2 we decided to choose a Python Framework to streamline the development of our dashboard.
* We chose Django to in order to MVC our project and also since it is considered an industry standard framework in Python and back-end development.
* The resources we used for this phase included Django(MVC),Postgres(database),Apache(hosting), and HTML for our table.
* The majority of the time was spent inside of the Linux terminal setting up the formalities of Django which proved to be the most difficult part of the phase.
* Moving forward, we have decided on 2 goals
  * Implement a CRUD tool to allow users to create, read, update and delete records through the webpage without having to make the changes in postgres.
  * Utilize the Bootstrap CSS framework to create attractive and readable tables.
